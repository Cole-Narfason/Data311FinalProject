# Data311FinalProject
Data311 Final Project from the University of Calgary

This project is from my SQL Databases course at the University of Calgary called Data 311.
In this project I created a Database and Schema in MySQL.
Then populated the tables with data about NHL players from the past 3 seasons from NHL.com.
I then answered 10 questions about the dataset with visualizations created from self-made SQL queries to MySQL from the notebook.

For the last question I created a custom user input tool in which I plan on using during my Fantasy Hockey Draft this year
with my friends as a quick way to check a few of the main players statistics and potential trends before I draft a player to my fantasy team.
